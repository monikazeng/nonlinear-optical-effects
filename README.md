a developed computational model to estimate nonlinear characteristics of various optical crystals for non-linear optical effects

This is a developed computational model to estimate nonlinear characteristics of various optical crystals for non-linear optical effects. The project focused on the process of second harmonic generation, which is when two photons with the same frequency interact with a nonlinear material and generate a new photon with twice the frequency, in the case of continuous light beams. To calculate the angles at which the nonlinear crystals need to be tuned for achieving SHG, a phase matching condition will be applied, requiring that the wave vectors of the fundamental radiation and second-harmonic radiation are equal. 
The code will calculate the phase matching angles and I had applied on 5 different birefringent materials: both uniaxial crystals (BaB2O4, and KD2PO4) and biaxial crystals (LiB3O5 , KTiOAsO4 and Ba3(ZnB5O10)PO4 ), and a noncommercial material BZBP.

** For each type of crystal, its wavelength dependent refractive index is calculated based on the Sellmeier equation. From the calculated refractive index, an equation to calculate the crystal cut angle(s) can be derived.
